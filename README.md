# Argyle

Argyle is a minimalist webserver that supports just enough functionality to be useful. 
That also gives it the property of being tiny. 

## Build and Run

1. Edit `S_BASE_BATH` in `FilenameResolver.cpp` to point at the directory
   containing your website. Do not include a trailing slash.
2. Edit the paths in `Logger.cpp` for each of the logfiles.
3. Build with `make`. Run `sudo ./argyle`. Hope it works.
